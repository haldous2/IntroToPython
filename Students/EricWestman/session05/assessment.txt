def count_backwards():
    for x in range(100, 0, -7):
        print x

if __name__ == "__main__":
    count_backwards()

3a.
For each line (x) in the following method, describe the circumstances under which
it will run.

def do_some_stuff():
try:
    doSomething1() # Line (a)
    doSomething2() # Line (b)
    return getValue1() # Line (c)
except:
    doSomeErrorHandling() # Line (d)
    return getValue2() # Line (e)
finally:
    doSomeCleanup() # Line (f)
doSomething3() #Line (g)

line a: will run first - always
line b: will run if line a doesn't crash
line c: will run if line a and b don't crash - and if getValue doesn't crash
line d: will run if a,b,c or getValue crash
line e: will run if a,b,c or getValue crash
line f: will always run
line g: will always run - not a part of the try block

3b. List all of the possible execution sequences of the lines in the above code

1: a, b, c, f, g
2: a, b, d, e, f, g
3: a, d, e, f, g
